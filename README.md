# reaction-menu
This is an NPM module built on top of `reaction-core` that facilitates easy
creation of interactive menu systems using Discord's reaction system.

## Development

Additional functionality is planned to be added in the future, so stay tuned!

## Basic Usage

### To-Do:
 - [ ] Make errors cleaner (this module is promise-based, and currently rejected
   errors aren't very pretty or descriptive.)
 - [ ] Finish this list.
